# Hijraah - Multi-Agent System for Islamic Community Services

## Overview

Hijraah is a comprehensive multi-agent system designed to serve the Islamic community through specialized AI agents that provide guidance, support, and services aligned with Islamic principles and values.

## What is Hijraah?

Hijraah (derived from "Hijrah" - the Islamic migration) is a platform that leverages multi-agent AI systems to provide:

- **Islamic Knowledge & Guidance**: Prayer times, Quranic references, Hadith, and Fiqh rulings
- **Financial Services**: Zakat calculation, Islamic banking, and Shariah-compliant investments
- **Community Coordination**: Event planning, volunteer management, and support networks
- **Migration Support**: Visa assistance, cultural adaptation, and settlement services
- **Analytics & Insights**: Data-driven community insights and service optimization

## Multi-Agent Architecture

The system consists of six specialized agents working together:

1. **User Interface Agent**: Manages user interactions and intent analysis
2. **Knowledge Agent**: Provides Islamic knowledge and educational resources
3. **Financial Agent**: Handles Islamic finance and banking services
4. **Community Agent**: Facilitates community interactions and coordination
5. **Migration Agent**: Assists with migration-related services
6. **Analytics Agent**: Provides data-driven insights and recommendations
