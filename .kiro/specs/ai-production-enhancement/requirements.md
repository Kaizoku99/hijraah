# AI Production Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for transforming Hijraah's AI system into a production-ready, enterprise-grade platform. The enhancement addresses critical gaps in security, performance, observability, and data quality while implementing advanced AI capabilities including guardrails, semantic caching, agentic workflows, and comprehensive monitoring.

The implementation follows a phased approach prioritizing security and safety, then performance optimization, advanced features, and finally comprehensive monitoring and compliance.
