## TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION NOTES

### Context7 Documentation First Rule (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Before implementing any task, you MUST use the Context7 MCP server to get the latest documentation for all technologies involved.

**Process**:

1. **Identify Technologies**: List all frameworks, libraries, and services the task will use
2. **Resolve Library IDs**: Use `resolve_library_id()` for each technology
3. **Get Latest Docs**: Use `get_library_docs()` with specific topics relevant to the task implementation
4. **Apply Current Patterns**: Always prioritize Context7 documentation over potentially outdated knowledge

**Key Technologies to Always Check**:

- **AI SDK v5**: `/vercel/ai` - For agent patterns, tool usage, and multi-step execution
- **Supabase**: `/supabase/supabase` - For database operations and real-time features
- **Next.js 15**: `/vercel/next.js` - For server actions and app router integration
- **Turborepo**: `/vercel/turborepo` - For monorepo task orchestration
- **Firecrawl**: For web scraping and data acquisition patterns
- **Trigger.dev**: For background task orchestration

**Example Context7 Usage**:

```typescript
// Before implementing an AI SDK v5 agent
resolve_library_id("Vercel AI SDK");
get_library_docs("/vercel/ai", {
  topic: "generateObject, tools, stopWhen, orchestrator patterns",
  tokens: 8000,
});

// Before implementing Supabase integration
resolve_library_id("Supabase");
get_library_docs("/supabase/supabase", {
  topic: "Server-side client, RLS, real-time subscriptions",
  tokens: 5000,
});
```

**Firecrawl Integration**: All web scraping tasks should use Firecrawl's `scrapeUrl()`, `crawlUrl()`, and `batchScrapeUrls()` methods with structured extraction schemas following the existing codebase patterns.

**Document Processing**: Follow the existing `DocumentProcessor` pattern:

- **Web Content**: Firecrawl's `scrapeUrl()` with markdown format
- **Uploaded Files**: Mistral OCR via AI SDK's `generateText()` with multimodal capabilities
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model
- **Classification**: Mistral's `generateObject()` with structured Zod schemas

**AI SDK v5 Multi-Agent System (Official Release)**: The MAS package leverages AI SDK v5's officially released agent patterns including:

- **Orchestrator-Worker Pattern**: Using `generateObject` for planning and `Promise.all` for parallel worker execution with structured schemas
- **Parallel Processing Pattern**: Concurrent specialized agents using `Promise.all` with structured output aggregation and Zod validation
- **Evaluator-Optimizer Pattern**: Iterative improvement loops using quality assessment and feedback-based regeneration with `onStepFinish` callbacks
- **Sequential Processing Pattern**: Multi-step workflows using `stopWhen` conditions (replacing deprecated `maxSteps`) and `onStepFinish` for controlled execution
- **Tool-Based Agents**: Custom Supabase, Firecrawl, and Hijraah-specific tools using AI SDK v5's `tool` function with `inputSchema`/`outputSchema`
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Agent step tracking and performance monitoring using `onStepFinish` callbacks and `steps` property access
- **Dynamic Model Selection**: Intelligent model routing using `experimental_prepareStep` based on task complexity and requirements
- **Advanced Control**: Fine-grained execution control with `toolChoice`, `activeTools`, and `abortSignal` support

**Trigger.dev Orchestration**: Use Trigger.dev v4 for task orchestration, scheduling, and workflow management while leveraging Firecrawl for actual data acquisition and AI SDK v5 for agent coordination.

**AI SDK v5 Official Release Updates**:

- **stopWhen Conditions**: Replace deprecated `maxSteps` with flexible `stopWhen` conditions like `stepCountIs()`, `hasToolCall()`, or custom functions
- **Enhanced Tool Definition**: Use `inputSchema` and `outputSchema` with Zod for robust type safety and validation
- **Structured Output**: Leverage `generateObject` with comprehensive Zod schemas for predictable agent responses
- **Step Management**: Access detailed execution information through the `steps` property for debugging and monitoring
- **Advanced Control**: Utilize `experimental_prepareStep` for dynamic model selection and `activeTools` for tool management
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling with `abortSignal` support and retry mechanisms

## CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY

✅ **COMPLETED**: Foundation (Tasks 1, 2), Knowledge Graph (Task 3), Community Data (Task 4), AI SDK v5 MAS Framework (Task 18.1-18.5)

🔄 **NEXT PRIORITY**: Document Processing (Task 7) - This is the highest priority remaining task as it provides core user functionality for document upload and processing, which is essential for the immigration platform.

The foundation is complete with government scraping, policy detection, knowledge graph construction, community validation, and AI SDK v5 (Official Release) MAS framework with orchestrator-worker patterns, parallel processing, and specialized immigration agents. The next focus should be on document processing to enable core user functionality.

**AI SDK v5 Official Release Benefits**:

- **Production Stability**: No more beta warnings or breaking changes
- **Enhanced Performance**: Optimized execution with improved token usage tracking
- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery with `abortSignal` and retry mechanisms
- **Advanced Agent Patterns**: Mature orchestrator-worker, parallel processing, and evaluator-optimizer patterns
- **Robust Tool System**: Complete tool definition with input/output schemas and validation
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Detailed step tracking, performance metrics, and debugging capabilities
