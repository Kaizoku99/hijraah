# Task 4.2 Implementation Summary

## Community Validation and Verification Engine

### Status: COMPLETED ✅

This task implements a comprehensive community validation and verification engine using the latest patterns from Context7 documentation.

### Key Technologies & Patterns:

- **Trigger.dev v4**: Latest task() and schedules.task() patterns with proper retry configurations
- **AI SDK v5**: Uses generateObject() with prompt format (not deprecated messages format)
- **Supabase**: createClient() with proper TypeScript typing and server-side patterns
- **Zod Schemas**: Comprehensive validation schemas for structured data

### Implemented Tasks:

1. **validateCommunityDataTask**: 
   - AI-powered quality assessment using generateObject with structured schemas
   - Validates accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability
   - Stores validation results in community_validations table

2. **detectOutliersTask**: 
   - Scheduled daily outlier detection using statistical analysis
   - AI-powered contextual outlier identification
   - Groups experiences by pathway/country/milestone for comparison

3. **orchestratePeerReviewTask**: 
   - Workflow orchestration for collaborative validation
   - Selects qualified reviewers based on reputation scores
   - Creates peer review orchestration records

4. **calculateReputationScoresTask**: 
   - Daily scheduled reputation calculation using AI analysis
   - Comprehensive scoring across multiple dimensions
   - Updates user_reputations table with calculated scores

### Technical Highlights:

- **Latest AI SDK v5 Patterns**: All generateObject calls use the new `prompt` format
- **Proper Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch blocks with detailed logging
- **Database Integration**: Seamless integration with existing schema
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper Zod schemas
- **Performance**: Optimized queries and batch processing

### Context7 Compliance:

✅ Trigger.dev v4 task definitions and scheduling patterns
✅ AI SDK v5 generateObject with prompt format (not messages)
✅ Supabase createClient with proper server-side patterns
✅ TypeScript best practices with comprehensive type safety

The implementation is production-ready and follows all latest patterns from Context7 documentation.
