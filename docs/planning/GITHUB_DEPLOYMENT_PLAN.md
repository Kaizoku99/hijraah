---

## 🎯 **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

### **Phase 1: Code Quality & Security (CRITICAL)**

#### 1.1 **Environment Variables & Secrets Cleanup** 🔒
```bash
# Check for exposed secrets
git log --all --full-history -- "*.env*" --source --all
grep -r "sk-" . --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.json"
grep -r "API_KEY" . --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.json"

# Files to review and sanitize:
- .env.local
- .env.example
- All config files in /config/env/
- Supabase keys in /supabase/
- Trigger.dev secrets
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Replace all real API keys with placeholder values
- [ ] Ensure `.env.example` has safe placeholder values
- [ ] Add comprehensive `.gitignore` for secrets
- [ ] Document required environment variables

#### 1.2 **Sensitive Data Removal** 🧹
```bash
# Check for sensitive information
grep -r "localhost:3000" .
grep -r "real-email@" .
grep -r "password" . --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"
grep -r "token" . --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"
```

**Files to sanitize:**
- Database connection strings
- Personal email addresses
