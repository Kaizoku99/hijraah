# Next.js 15 Project Restructuring: Complete

This document summarizes the restructuring of the Hijraah project to follow Next.js 15 best practices while maintaining the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture.

## Completed Restructuring Tasks

- Created new directory structure based on Next.js 15 best practices
- Reorganized app directory with proper route grouping
- Migrated domain entities to domain-specific folders
- Migrated domain services to their respective domains
- Moved application services to the application layer
- Restructured Supabase integration (with port 54800 fix preserved)
- Reorganized API infrastructure
- Restructured repositories to follow DDD principles
- Migrated hooks to appropriate locations
- Organized UI components according to atomic design principles
- Deduplicated and removed duplicate implementations:
  - Removed duplicate case application services
  - Removed duplicate user application services
  - Removed duplicate document services
  - Removed duplicate infrastructure repositories
  - Removed duplicate domain entities (user, document, case, chat, roadmap)
  - Removed duplicate domain services
  - Removed duplicate hooks and utilities
  - Consolidated all application services to follow the \_application/services/ pattern
  - Consolidated all domain entities to the \_core/<domain>/entities/ pattern
  - Consolidated all domain services to the \_core/<domain>/services/ pattern
  - Consolidated all hooks to \_shared/hooks
  - Consolidated all utilities to \_shared/utils
  - Consolidated UI components to \_shared/ui
- Cleaned up old directory structure:
  - Removed old domain/ directory
  - Removed old application/ directory
  - Removed old infrastructure/ directory
  - Removed old presentation/ directory
  - Removed old shared/ directory
  - Removed old utils/ directory
  - Removed old hooks/ directory

## Important Configuration Notes

1. **Supabase Port Configuration**: The Supabase shadow_port has been changed from 54320 to 54800 in config.toml to avoid Windows port conflicts. This configuration must be maintained.

2. **Import Path Updates**: Refer to IMPORT_PATH_UPDATES.md for guidance on updating import paths to work with the new structure.

3. **App Directory Organization**: The app directory now uses Next.js 15 conventions with route groups and private folders.

## Next Steps

1. **Update Import Paths**: Update import paths throughout the codebase to reference the new locations.

2. **Test Functionality**: Test the application to ensure all features work with the new structure.

3. **Update Documentation**: Update project documentation to reflect the new architecture.

4. **Component Deduplication**: Continue to consolidate duplicate UI components.
