# Next.js Optimization Plan

## Current State Analysis

Our application is already using Next.js with the App Router, which is a good foundation. The configuration includes several optimizations like:

- Bundle analysis for monitoring bundle size
- CSS optimization for production
- Tree shaking and code splitting
- Internationalization with next-intl
- Image optimization

## Optimization Goals

1. **Performance Improvements**

   - Reduce initial page load time
   - Optimize core web vitals
   - Implement proper static/dynamic rendering strategies

2. **Developer Experience**

   - Improve build times
   - Enhance error handling and logging
   - Streamline deployment process

3. **SEO and Accessibility**
   - Implement comprehensive metadata
   - Improve accessibility scores
   - Add structured data for better search indexing

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Performance Optimizations

#### 1. Implement Route Segmentation

- [ ] Review and optimize route groups
- [ ] Implement proper loading states for each route
- [ ] Add error boundaries for all critical sections

#### 2. Optimize Static vs. Dynamic Rendering

- [ ] Audit all routes for proper rendering strategy
- [ ] Convert eligible routes to static rendering
- [ ] Implement ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) where appropriate

#### 3. Image and Asset Optimization

- [ ] Migrate to Next.js Image component for all images
- [ ] Implement responsive image strategies
- [ ] Set up proper image caching policies

### Phase 2: Advanced Features

#### 1. Set up Vercel Analytics

- [ ] Install and configure @vercel/analytics
- [ ] Set up custom events tracking
- [ ] Create performance dashboards

#### 2. Implement API Response Caching

- [ ] Set up SWR or React Query for data fetching
- [ ] Implement proper cache invalidation strategies
- [ ] Add optimistic UI updates

#### 3. Component-Level Code Splitting

- [ ] Implement dynamic imports for heavy components
- [ ] Set up Suspense boundaries around dynamic imports
- [ ] Create fallback UI for loading states

### Phase 3: SEO and Accessibility

#### 1. Metadata Implementation

- [ ] Create comprehensive metadata objects for all routes
- [ ] Implement OpenGraph and Twitter card metadata
- [ ] Set up JSON-LD structured data

#### 2. Accessibility Improvements

- [ ] Run accessibility audit
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation
- [ ] Add proper ARIA attributes to all components

## Monitoring and Validation

1. **Performance Metrics**

   - Set up Core Web Vitals monitoring
   - Implement Lighthouse CI
   - Create performance budgets

2. **User Experience Metrics**
   - Track user engagement
   - Measure bounce rates
   - Monitor conversion paths

## Next Steps

1. Create a detailed implementation schedule
2. Set up automation for performance monitoring
3. Begin implementation of Phase 1 tasks
